# Paco's Simple Godot Soundboard
### Why?
When this project was started, I played Fortnite a ton with my friends. I used YouTube for many of my sound effects.  
But YouTube is slow and impractical because it's... anything _but_ a soundboard.  
So I thought, screw it, why not.  
### How to use the Program
Just download the program and figure it out. Should be easy.
If you want to delete the program... 
Open the program,
Click the folder button 
Delete the program (eg. Windows users delete the .exe)
Delete everything inside the 'Hand-Made Soundboard' folder.
### Compiling and Editing
This was made in Godot 4.1.  
So to do anything to the program, get Godot 4.1, and open the source code.  
And if you want to compile it, follow the instructions on the Godot 4 documentation.
