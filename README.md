# Paco's Simple Godot Soundboard
### Why?
When this project was started, I played Fortnite a ton with my friends. I used YouTube for many of my sound effects.  
But YouTube is slow and impractical because it's... anything _but_ a soundboard.  
So I thought, screw it, why not.  
### How to use the Program
Just download the program, run it, and figure it out. Should be easy.
If you want to delete the program...  
1. Open the program,
2. Click the folder button 
3. Delete the program (eg. Windows users delete the .exe)
4. **IF** you want to also destroy your save data, delete everything inside the 'Hand-Made Soundboard' folder.
### Compiling, Contributing, etc.
This was made in Godot 4.1.  
As such, all you gotta do is get Godot 4.1, open the project, and do whatever.
And if you want to compile it, follow the instructions on the Godot 4 documentation.
