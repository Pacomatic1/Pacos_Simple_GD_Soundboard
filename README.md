# Paco's Simple Godot Soundboard
### Why?
When this project was started, I played Fortnite a ton with my friends. I used YouTube for many of my sound effects.  
But YouTube is slow and impractical because it's... anything _but_ a soundboard.  
So I thought, screw it, why not.  
### Using the Program
Should be obvious.
### Compiling and Editing
This was made in Godot 4.1.  
So to do anything to the program, get Godot 4.1, and open the source code.  
And if you want to compile it, follow the instructions on the Godot 4 documentation.
