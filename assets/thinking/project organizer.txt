TASKS ON DA LIST-------------------------------------------
	README
		Tasks are prioritized base ont heir order in the list; everything at the top will be of high priority, while everything at the bottom will be of low priority. And since we're using Godot, you should hopefully  be able to comprehend how each task has parents, children, and blah blah blah. If you cannot, then why are you here?
	TO DO
		Add grid so you can actually USE THE SOUNDBOARD 😲😲🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀😲😲 (I'm so sorry)
			Grid Layout - Complete
				Add object to do the sound thing
					Load functionality
					image Preview
		Functioning audio player
		Figure out a way to tab out of a textedit
	BACKBURNER AND NOT PRIORITY
		Profile support (do it once the thing actualy works)
			- Should mostly be a reload and some stuff in the global module (if i was smart :/)
